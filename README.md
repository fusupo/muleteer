# Escapement

**Claude Code plugin for structured development workflows.** Regulated workflow, one tick at a time.

## What This Is

Escapement is an opinionated workflow and Claude Code plugin that provides reusable modules to streamline your development process:

- **meta-workflow:** A prescribed sequential process supported by the plugin modules
- **Skills**: Automated workflow modules (issue setup, commits, PRs, etc.)
- **Hooks**: Session archiving on compaction
- **Agents**: Specialized AI assistants (scratchpad-planner for codebase analysis)
- **Multi-Project Support**: Works across all your repos simultaneously

## Workflow Overview

Escapement guides you from idea to merged code through a structured workflow:

1. **Initialize** (`setup-work`) - Pull GitHub issue → Generate scratchpad plan → Create feature branch
2. **Execute** (`do-work` + `commit-changes`) - Work through scratchpad tasks → Make atomic commits
3. **Review** (`create-pr` + `review-pr`) - Create pull request → Review changes → Merge
4. **Archive** (`archive-work`) - Clean up scratchpad → Preserve session history

Each phase is handled by specialized skills that activate via natural language or explicit commands.

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fusupo/escapement.git

# Run Claude Code with the plugin
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement
```

### From Marketplace (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Once published to a marketplace
/plugin install escapement
```

## Usage

### High-Level Workflow

Work proceeds through four phases:

* **Initialize**: establish scope and plan
* **Execute**: implement planned work in small steps
* **Review**: validate and merge changes
* **Archive**: preserve artifacts and session history

The phases are sequential but not strictly linear; refinement can push work backward before execution begins.

### Initialize (`prime-session`, `setup-work`)

The session begins either from an idea or an existing GitHub issue.

If needed, project context is loaded by reading `CLAUDE.md` and related documentation.
An issue is created or fetched, then analyzed to produce a scratchpad plan.

If the issue is too large, it is decomposed into sub-issues.
If assumptions are invalid, the issue may be reworked before proceeding.

A feature branch is created once the plan is acceptable.

Operator involvement is primarily directional: clarifying intent and approving scope.

### Execute (`do-work`, `commit-changes`)

Work is driven by the scratchpad.

Tasks are selected one at a time, implemented, and committed as atomic changes following project conventions.
This loop continues until the scratchpad is complete.

The operator may intervene to adjust task order, clarify intent, or pause execution, but most actions are automated.

### Review (`create-pr`, `review-pr`)

A pull request is created with full context from the scratchpad and commit history.

The PR is reviewed.
If changes are requested, work resumes and new commits are added before re-review.

This cycle repeats until the changes are accepted and merged.

Operator involvement is typically focused on decision-making and judgment rather than mechanics.

### Archive (`archive-work`, hooks)

After merge, the scratchpad is archived.

Before Claude Code compacts the session, the transcript is saved via the PreCompact hook.
This preserves planning, execution, and review context as durable artifacts.

The session is then considered complete.

### Full Workflow Map

This diagram shows all phases together, with swimlanes for each skill and the operator.

It illustrates where decisions occur, which actions are automated, and how control moves between skills over the life of a session.

## Skills

Skills are invoked automatically by Claude Code when relevant, or you can reference them explicitly with the `/escapement:` prefix:

**Natural Language Invocation:**
```bash
# Claude uses the skill automatically based on context
"Setup GitHub issue #42"
"Commit these changes"
"Create a PR for this branch"
```

**Explicit Invocation:**
```bash
/escapement:setup-work
/escapement:commit-changes
/escapement:create-pr
```

### Available Skills

| Skill            | Triggers                            | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `setup-work`     | "setup issue #X", "start issue #X"  | Fetch issue, create scratchpad, prepare branch |
| `commit-changes` | "commit", "commit these changes"    | Smart commits with conventional format         |
| `create-pr`      | "create a PR", "open pull request"  | Context-aware PR creation                      |
| `review-pr`      | "review PR #X", "check this PR"     | Roadmap-aware code review                      |
| `do-work`        | "start working", "continue work"    | Execute tasks from scratchpad                  |
| `archive-work`   | "archive this work", "clean up"     | Move completed scratchpads to archive          |
| `prime-session`  | "orient me", "what is this project" | Read project docs for context                  |

## Hooks

Escapement includes a **PreCompact hook** that archives your session transcript before Claude Code's automatic compaction. This preserves your work history in `SESSION_LOG_{N}.md` files.

**Requirements:** `jq` must be installed for the hook to function.

## Agents

Specialized subagents for delegation and deep analysis:

### scratchpad-planner

**Automatically invoked** during `setup-work` (Phase 2) for codebase analysis and implementation planning.

**Capabilities:**
- Reads project's CLAUDE.md for conventions and structure
- Analyzes codebase using Grep, LSP, and code search patterns
- Identifies affected modules and integration points
- Finds similar implementations to learn from
- Generates atomic task breakdowns following project conventions
- Asks clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
- Supports resumable analysis for complex codebases

**Benefits:**
- **Specialized expertise**: Replaces generic exploration with focused planning methodology
- **Project awareness**: Adapts to each project's conventions and architecture
- **Resumability**: Can be resumed across sessions for iterative refinement
- **Context preservation**: Maintains full analysis context, reducing repetition

The scratchpad-planner agent transforms GitHub issues into concrete, well-structured implementation plans with atomic, reviewable tasks.

## Philosophy

**Escapement workflow principles:**

1. **Structured approach** - Clear workflow from issue to merge
2. **Incremental progress** - Atomic commits, reviewable changes
3. **Project awareness** - Adapts to each project's conventions
4. **Multi-project friendly** - Works across all your repos

## Per-Project Customization

Escapement works across multiple projects. Each project customizes its workflow via its own `CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown

# In your-project/CLAUDE.md

## Project Modules

- **api**: REST API endpoints
- **frontend**: React UI components
- **database**: Database layer

## Commit Message Format

{module emoji}{change type emoji} {type}({scope}): {description}

Example: feat(api): Add user authentication endpoint

```

See `docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md` for detailed examples and patterns.

## Development

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create directory: `skills/your-skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: What this skill does. Invoke when user says "trigger phrase".
   tools:
     - mcp__github__*
     - Read
     - Write
   ---

   # Your Skill

   ## Purpose
   ...
   ```
3. Test: `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement`
4. Commit and push

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/your-agent.md`
2. Define specialized expertise
3. List required tools in frontmatter
4. Test: `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement`
5. Commit and push

### Adding Hooks

Edit `hooks/hooks.json` following the [Claude Code hooks documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks).

## Multi-Project Support

Escapement is installed **once** as a plugin but works across **all your projects**:

```bash
# Load plugin
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement

# Per-project customization
~/projects/project-a/CLAUDE.md    # Project A's conventions
~/projects/project-b/CLAUDE.md    # Project B's conventions
~/projects/relica/CLAUDE.md       # Relica's conventions
```

Skills automatically detect the current project and read its `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

```bash
# Verify plugin structure
ls -la /path/to/escapement/.claude-plugin/

# Should show:
# plugin.json

# Check manifest is valid JSON
cat /path/to/escapement/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | jq .
```

### Skills not appearing

```bash
# Verify skills exist
ls -la /path/to/escapement/skills/

# Restart Claude Code with plugin
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/escapement
```

### Hooks not working

```bash
# Ensure jq is installed
which jq

# Check hooks.json is valid
cat /path/to/escapement/hooks/hooks.json | jq .

# Verify hook script is executable
ls -la /path/to/escapement/hooks/archive-session-log.sh
```
